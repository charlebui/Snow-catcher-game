# Snow-catcher-game
I wanted to make a first solo project to learn more about java and it's different frameworks so I made a snow catcher game using LIBGDX.
Learned a lot about LIBGDX and some game physics.
The goal of this game is to catch falling snow with a bucket. It could still use some polishing, but I will move on to other projects now.

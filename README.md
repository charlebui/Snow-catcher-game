# Snow-catcher-game
Made a snow catcher game a while ago using LIBGDX. 
The goal of this game is to catch falling snow with a bucket.

You can run this on any java IDE after setting DesktopLauncher as main class.

I exported a .jar file after completing the program and tried to run it but got an "unable to access jarfile error"

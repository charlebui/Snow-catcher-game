# Snow-catcher-game
I wanted to make a first solo project to learn more about java and it's different frameworks, and kind of wanted to try to get a quick view of game development so I made a snow catcher game using LIBGDX. Learned a lot about LIBGDX and some game physics.
This was a very fun project to build, adding the art and music you want and creating something from scratch is a very satisfying feeling.


The goal of this game is to catch falling snow with a bucket. Each time you catch a snowball you get a point, and you can keep going as long as you want, it is a very zen game. It could still use some polishing, but I will move on to other projects now.

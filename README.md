# Snow-catcher-game
I wanted to make a first solo project to learn more about java and it's different frameworks so I made a snow catcher game using LIBGDX. 
The goal of this game is to catch falling snow with a bucket. It could still use some polishing, but I will move on to other projects now.
You can run this on any java IDE after setting DesktopLauncher as main class.
Everything works until you export it into a .jar file.

I exported a .jar file after completing the program and tried to run it but got an "unable to access jarfile error".
